## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my experiments, code snippets, and notes as I learn machine learning and work towards building a simple Large Language Model. The goal is to document my progress and share my learning journey with others who might be interested in the same topics.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitexleo/llminit.git
